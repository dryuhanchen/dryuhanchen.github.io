<b>Abstract:</b> The <i>Medical Improvement Monthly</i> was founded in March 1941 by Li Sichi, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioner from Chengdu. It ceased publication around October 1943. The journal was one of the most important TCM publications in the Chengdu region during the Republic of China era. Its publication reflected the dedication of figures from the Sichuan TCM community, represented by Li Sichi, and their desire for the improvement and flourishing of TCM, with the goal of saving the country and its people. As a professional publication, it balanced academic content with popular science, but ultimately ceased publication due to factors such as soaring prices and poor management. The fate of <i>Medical Improvement Monthly</i> sheds light on the challenges faced by the TCM industry and academic journals in the Republic of China era.
