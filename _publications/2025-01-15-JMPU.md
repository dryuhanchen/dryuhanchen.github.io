<b>Abstract:</b>In 1932, the Shanghai Municipal Government spent nearly a thousand yuan to purchase a tiger as part of its efforts to establish a municipal zoo. This marked the first time a tiger was displayed in a Shanghai zoo, drawing large crowds and becoming the zoo's undeniable star. The zoo carefully designed a secure and sturdy enclosure for the tiger, and visitors closely followed its diet and well-being. Unfortunately, the tiger passed away from illness three years later, sparking significant public discussion and even commercial interest from pharmaceutical companies. Only after the zoo acquired a new tiger did it manage to mitigate the negative impact of its absence. This paper aims to examine the tiger's life at the Shanghai Municipal Zoological Garden from a biographical perspective, using this as a lens to explore broader issues such as enclosure design, animal care, medical health, public opinion, and animal procurement, thereby considering the significance of the "animal turn" in the study of modern Chinese history.
