The Shanghai Juvenile Police was a team established by the Shanghai Municipal Police Department in response to the conservation movement in the late period of the New Life Movement. Its members were street children taken in by child care institutions. After training, they went to restaurants and hotels to persuade people to save money at banquets, but the results were not ideal, and they were controversial and even insulted. Since then, the team has been constantly transforming in operation, and with the joint cooperation of the Health Bureau and the Police Department, it has gradually transformed into a health police whose main task is to check the cleanliness of lanes. But soon, the corruption within the juvenile police and the increasingly tense financial problems of the Shanghai Municipal Government led to the dissolution of the team. In fact, it is not a police agency with full powers, and its ultimate failure is directly related to its unclear powers and responsibilities, single means, and low quality of police officers.
