<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
I am a young scholar who graduated from the History Department of Fudan University and currently work at the Institute of History of Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences (SASS). My research interests focus on Chinese history in the 1930s and 1940s. My doctoral dissertation was titled “The Zoo in Modern China,” which examined the development of China’s zoo from the late Qing Dynasty to the mid-20th century. Some chapters of this paper have been published.
